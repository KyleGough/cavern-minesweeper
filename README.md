<h1>Cavern Minesweeper</h1>
<p>Cavern Minesweeper is based off of the original Minesweeper game but with tiered mines (ores) which can only be mined if the player has uncovered enough squares to advance to the required mining level. The game has three levels of difficulty to challenge competitive players.</p>

<p>This project served as a tool to teach me Ruby.</p>

## Features
- Three playable difficulties.
- Tiered Ores which damage the player if their level is not sufficient enough.
- Flood Fill algorithm for revealing tiles.
- Shoes GUI.
